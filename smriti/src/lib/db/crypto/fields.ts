/**
 * Which fields of which local tables are encrypted at rest.
 *
 * Only personal or health content is listed, and never an indexed field:
 * IndexedDB builds indexes from the stored value, so an encrypted field can't
 * be queried with `where()`. Ids, foreign keys, timestamps and `synced` flags
 * stay readable so every existing query keeps working. `speechCache` is left
 * out because it holds generic spoken phrases, not anything about a person.
 *
 * Adding a field here is safe for existing installs: rows written before are
 * still read as plain text (see `middleware.ts`) and get encrypted the next
 * time they are written. Bump `ENCRYPTION_MIGRATION_VERSION` in `keys.ts` to
 * re-encrypt old rows eagerly on next open.
